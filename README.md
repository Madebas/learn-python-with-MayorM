Hello there! I'm Mayor M.
Welcome to my Python learning journey a space where curiosity meets code.

I didn‚Äôt start out as a programmer. In fact, I come from a background where tech was more of a tool than a craft.
But something about Python its simplicity, its power, and its community pulled me in. What began as a few lines of code quickly turned into a passion for building, solving, and understanding how things work under the hood.

This repository is more than just a collection of scripts and projects. It‚Äôs a reflection of my growth, my persistence, and my commitment to becoming a better developer every day. From basic syntax to real-world problem solving, each file here tells a story of learning by doing.

Why this matters to me and maybe to you too
For learners: If you're just starting out, I hope this repo shows you that progress is possible. I‚Äôve documented my steps, mistakes, and breakthroughs so others can learn from them too.
For employers: This isn‚Äôt just code, it‚Äôs evidence of my mindset. I‚Äôm a self-starter, a problem-solver, and someone who‚Äôs not afraid to dive deep and figure things out. I believe in clean code,
continuous learning, and contributing to something bigger than myself.
What you'll find here
